# Making Web Pages Assessible

## Refactor Code
This project involves makin small changes to existing code.

## Description
This project main aims are to introduce bootcamp students to the use of semantic HTML elements and the use of the alt attributes to images and icons to make a web page most assessible. This project uses starter code so beginners do not have to worry about building a web page from scrtach. Task includes changing div id=header to the use on <header></header> for example within an HTML file. CSS was also explored and where there was .header in the style, the dot was removed to followed the semantic style. Last but not least this project involved using git push and pull commands. I had to do my project again as I forgot to set up main amd feature branches. So if you don't want to start all over again do things the right way.
